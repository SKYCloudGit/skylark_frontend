        <h2>Access Control & Roles</h2>
        <p>
          The application controls what you can see and do based on your assigned user role. The
          navigation sidebar will <strong>only show the modules</strong> that are relevant to your
          permissions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Super Admin:</strong> Has full access to all features, including the ability to
            manage all users and roles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Admin:</strong> Manages users and permissions within their assigned scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Distributor:</strong> Has access to modules relevant to distributing water
            meters and managing consumer accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manufacturer:</strong> Has specific access to tools for managing inventory and
            quality control.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Within each module, specific buttons and actions (e.g., "Delete," "Update," "Configure")
          may be <strong>enabled or disabled based on your `auth ID` and permissions.</strong> This
          ensures you can only perform actions you are authorized to.

      <Card className="mb-4 p-3 shadow-sm">
        <h2>üåç Area Management</h2>
        <p>
          This module is used to organize your water distribution network into a clear, geographical
          hierarchy. This two-part process involves first defining the levels of your hierarchy, and
          then adding data to those levels.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <strong>Hierarchy Titles</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is where you **define the labels or categories for your network's structure**. For
          example, you might define titles such as "State," "Zone," "Circle," and "Area." These
          titles establish the different levels you will use to organize your data later.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <strong>Add Hierarchy</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once your hierarchy titles are set, this is where you **add the actual data** to each
          level. This creates the specific nested structure of your network.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step-by-step example:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Select the **Parent Hierarchy** from the dropdown (e.g., if you are adding a State,
              the parent might be the Country).
            </li>
            <li>Select the **Hierarchy Title** you wish to add (e.g., "State").</li>
            <li>Enter the **data** for that title (e.g., "Maharashtra").</li>
            <li>
              This action will create a new item under the parent, making it ready for you to add
              the next level of data beneath it (e.g., adding a "Zone" under "Maharashtra").
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>
          <strong>Manage Hierarchy Items</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Edit:</strong> To update a hierarchy item's name or reassign it, find the item
            and click the "Edit" button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delete:</strong> To remove an item, click the "Delete" button. **Note:**
            Deleting a parent hierarchy will also delete all of its child hierarchies. The system
            will ask for confirmation before proceeding.
